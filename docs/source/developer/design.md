# Design

## Goals

The goal of this repo is to prototype a data model to support simultaneous distributed
editing in Jupyter.

Fundamentally, it's about taking the **existing** concepts[^f1] provided by Jupyter server and creating a real time data model on top of them.

This would help provide a Google Docs like editing experience in Jupyter editors by
allowing multiple simultaneous users to edit a document at once.

It would do this by moving much of the state to be shared on the server as well,
which would also help address some other long-running issues with Jupyter, around
preserving outputs even after you close your browser and dealing with race conditions
around kernel management.

This will happen in a number of different layers, added to this monorepo:

1. Base: CRDT implementation, lumino and/or other JS implementations
2. Middle: Friendly real time datastore using this with React integration
3. Higher level/Jupyter: Support for editing all data in Jupyter server
4. Jupyter clients: JupyterLab integration, Spyder integration, nteract integration (examples)

## Non Goals

There are also a number of other ways to improve collaboration in Jupyter which this repo is not meant to address, at least initially.

It is not meant to be able to synchronize notebooks or work between Jupyter servers
running on multiple machines.

It doesn't overlap with JupyterHub in that JupyterHub is about spawning multiple instances and this is about providing one instance for collaborative purposes.

It also isn't about providing concepts of Teams, Projects, Groups, etc. These are definitely useful to have in a collaborative environment but for the initial work here we are assuming the same permission-less structure of a regular Jupyter server.

It's also often useful to share what environment you are in with your notebook, to make it more reproducible. This isn't about that kind of collaboration either.
