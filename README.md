# Jupyter Real Time Collaboration ![.github/workflows/nodejs.yml](https://github.com/jupyterlab/rtc/workflows/.github/workflows/nodejs.yml/badge.svg)

This **Real Time Collaboration** monorepo contains current work on Real Time
collaboration for use in JupyterLab and other Jupyter applications.

## Project Meeting Schedule

We have a bi-weekly meeting call. Please come and join! All are welcome to come
and just listen or discuss any work related to this project. They are also
recorded and available here.

For the time, place and notes, see [this hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@_4xc7QhhSHKODRQn1uiulw/BkV24I3qL/edit).

We also use hackmd to set an agenda and to capture notes for these meetings.

## Learning Pathway

We are striving to keep meetings productive and on topic. If you are joining
us for the first time or need a refresher about the project's scope, we
recommend reading the following documents:

- This `README.md`.
- The [Specification](https://jupyter-rtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/spec.html): We are working on creating a living specification for the protocol(s) created here. We're doing our best but it may not always be totally in sync with explorations in the repo, until they are settled on.
- The [Design](https://jupyter-rtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/design.html) document.
- The [Architecture](https://jupyter-rtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/architecture.html) document.
- Vision in [grant proposal for CZI](https://jupyter-rtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/organisation/czi-2020.html).

## Develop

Follow the instructions documented on the [examples](https://jupyter-rtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/examples.html).

## Contribute

We welcome any and all contributions and ideas here! This is a big task and we
will need as much help as we can get. The [contribute](https://jupyter-rtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/organisation/contribute.html)
page contains more specific information.

## Current Work on JupyterLab

Most of the work currently is living in [a PR to JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/6871) and documented in [an issue](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5382).

The overall roadmap is defined in [Real Time Collaboration Plan](https://github.com/jupyterlab/team-compass/issues/30).
